# Task Completed:
- Read Chapter 1 of "Linux Basics for Hackers"
- Watched Kevin Stratvert's video on Git and Github Tutorial for Beginners
- Manipulated and edited a few of the files I already have in my Ubuntu home directory.
- Created the "cf-cloud89-submission.md" file that I will use for this submission using the 'touch' command.

# Additional Notes
  I already have Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS installed on VirtualBox in my PC, so I didn't install Kali Linux again. 
  However, I installed a lightweight version of Ubuntu (Xubuntu/XFCE) today because the default one (GNOME) is a bit slow on my PC.
