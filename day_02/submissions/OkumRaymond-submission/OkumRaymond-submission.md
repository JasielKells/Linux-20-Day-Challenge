Task Completed:
Practiced using cat, more, less, head, tail, cut, sort, uniq, and wc
Used grep with multiple flags and patterns
Redirected output using > and >>, and use pipes |
Created a sample log file and search through it with grep

Additional Notes
It was a fun exercise to carry out, I'm somewhat familiar with the commands and I have attached a screenshot to show some of the commands I used.
grep is especially useful for searches!
